//! Traits for constructing/destructuring from/into a type's internal guts.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! mod state_machine {
//!     use guts::{Guts, FromGutsUnchecked};
//!
//!     /// A State machine's internal state.
//!     pub enum State {
//!         Off,
//!         On,
//!     }
//!
//!     /// A State machine that hides its internal state.
//!     pub struct StateMachine {
//!         state: State,
//!     }
//!
//!     impl Default for StateMachine {
//!         /// Creates a state machine in the only allowed initial state: `Off`.
//!         fn default() -> Self {
//!             Self { state: State::Off }
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     impl Guts for StateMachine {
//!         type Guts = State;
//!     }
//!
//!     impl FromGutsUnchecked for StateMachine {
//!         /// Creates a state machine in an arbitrary state, unsafely.
//!         unsafe fn from_guts_unchecked(guts: Self::Guts) -> Self {
//!             Self { state: guts }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! use guts::FromGutsUnchecked;
//! use state_machine::{State, StateMachine};
//!
//! // A machine can easily be safely created in its initial state:
//! let machine = StateMachine::default();
//!
//! // To create a machine in a non-initial state `unsafe { â€¦ }` is required:
//! let machine = unsafe { StateMachine::from_guts_unchecked(State::On) };
//! ```
